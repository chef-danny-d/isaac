      "desc": "Nocturne—In music, a short composition of a romantic or dreamy character suggestive of night, typically for piano. My recent album release entitled, 'Nocturnes: The Strings Sessions' is an album of original nocturnes composed for friends and family members. The setting begins at about 5:00 PM and progresses down into the mysterious depths and landscapes of the dream realm. The music is comparable to a film score—it strives to establish setting, create atmosphere, and translate the ideas and stories held in my mind of various people, places, and experiences that have impacted my life. I hope to connect listeners to the emotions, feelings, and colors of the journey I’ve been on while writing the music for this recording. The music has evolved from solo piano (on the “Nocturnes” piano solo CD) to include a string quartet for this recording (featuring the StoweHaven String Quartet). The strings serve to underscore the piano and add depth to the music.",

I’ve received numerous requests over the years to record some of the pieces I play for preludes, offertories, and postludes at church. This recording is a fulfillment of those requests. I like to think of this recording as a healing album. These hymns are peaceful and I turn to them often when I’m in need of comfort. I hope that you enjoy them!",

This recording came at a time of great transition in my life when I left my home state of Arkansas to live in Tennessee. The Mississippi River separates the two states and it is the heartland of the Delta. I’ve always had an affinity for water (almost all of my CDs have water on the cover artwork). There is an underlying theme of connections, family, roots, brides from one location to another, and growing up into adulthood throughout this recording. It is a compilation of original songs and hymn arrangements.",
